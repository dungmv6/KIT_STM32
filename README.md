# KIT_STM32

A project that serves learning and developing firmware. Kit STM32 is built to be the foundation for developing an ecosystem like Arduino.
Some main functions are available on KIT as follows:
- Power supply from 7-30VDC
- 5V voltage on KIT with current up to 3A (Can be supplied directly to SIM module).
- Function to debug code directly on module via UART1 communication
- USB direct communication function on circuit
- Programming and loading simple program via SWD standard
- Flexibility in choosing the program load mode
- Peripheral up to 42 GPIO including STM32 interfaces such as ADC, PWM, GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART ...
- The board is the same size as Arduino
